issue is not showing all topics and also it showing same topics and it fetch same topics

what I want is I want to fetch topics realted to

dont fetch all news topic make sure fetch algo work in advanced mode

and also all the news related to the niche I added is current of 24 hours because my video are based on the current

so make sure dont fetch duplication fetch unique and only 10 topics and also add tags and category of each card based on the conten and also I want ot see the original soruce link so see the original source

make sure add the bulk delete options also right now only single delte options there

see image 2

this not showing any data and also when I click on trigger automation nothing happened

I just go to
/settings

so see image 3

what the use of this if I add this all in frontned or I addd this all in backend

and I have a doubt regarding the

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
Google Cloud credentials for Text-to-Speech API
I already mentiond this in the secret file

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./credentials.json"

so under the credenntials.json I alreay added this

{
"type": "service_account",
"project_id": "magnetic-racer-442915-u4",
"private_key_id": "3fd7d7a6bf0130d1f",
"private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQCYMv/IJG6vqW51\n/fh8EJVF9QgrTdYK2hj\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
"client_email": "youtube-automation@magnetic-racer-442915-u4.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
"client_id": "1002569489",
"auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
"token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
"auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
"client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/youtube-automation%40magnetic-racer-442915-u4.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
"universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}

but I use the logic to upload on the google drive also so I created another service accoutn for google drive and there is another json fole there for that so I enabled google drive service on google cloud and also enabled text to sppech so I need to add the google drive json also here or it is not requried

becasue still the file upload not work

also why the video creation model and the thumnnai creation model not work why
